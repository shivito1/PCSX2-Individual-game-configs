# PCSX2-Individual-game-configs
I have created a script that will copy game configs to a root folder. When a string is passed to my script it will check the root config location and see if the title of the game has a config or not. if it does it will move that config to the PCSX2 config folder and then boot the game.

# ZIP contains .EXE packaged version of ps2exposed
Unzip and run ps2exposed.exe then use the buttons to configure each path. important if pcsx2 is running this exe will assume you are trying to run a game and the GUI will not open. 

After configuration point your frontend to the ps2exposed.exe insted of the pcsx2.exe emulator.
