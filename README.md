# PCSX2-Individual-game-configs
I have created a script that will copy game configs to a root folder. When a string is passed to my script it will check the root config location and see if the title of the game has a config or not. if it does it will move that config to the PCSX2 config folder and then boot the game.

# ZIP contains .EXE packaged version of ps2exposed
Unzip and run ps2exposed.exe then use the buttons to configure each path. important: run ps2exposed.exe and configure the rom, ini and pcsx2.exe paths before trying to point your front-end to ps2exposed.exe
